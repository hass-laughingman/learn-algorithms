# Node-Based Data Structure

1. Add a method to the `LinkedList` class that prints all the elements of the list.

2. Add a method to the `DoubleLinkedList` class that prints all the elements of the list in reverse order.

3. Add a method to the `LinkedList` class that returns the last element from the list. Assume you don't know how many elements are in the list.

4. Add a method to `LinkedList` class that reverses the list. That is if the original list is A -> B -> C, all of the list's links should change so that C -> B -> A

5. Let's say you jave access to a node from somewhere in the middle of a LinkedList, but not the LinkedList itself. That is, you have a variable that points to an instance of Node, but you don't have access to the LinkedList instance. In this situation, if you follow this node's link, you can find all the items from this middle node until the end, but you have no way to find the nodes that preceed this node in the list. Write code that iwll effectively delete this node from the list. The entire remaining list should remain complete, withonly this node removed.
