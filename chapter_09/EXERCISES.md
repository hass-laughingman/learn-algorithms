# Crafting Elegant Code with Stacks and Queues

1. If you were writing softwarre for a call center that places callers on hold and then assigns them to "the next available representative", would you use a stack or a queue?


2. If you pushed numbers onto a stack in the following order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and then popped two items, which number would you be able to read from the stack?


3. If you inserted numbers into a queue in the following order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and then dequeued two items, which number would you be able to read from the queue?


4. Write a function that uses a stack to reverse a string.
